Description:
 wrapper of fopen/fclose for linux 32 bit.
 There is a limit of a file size on 32 bit linux (normaly 2GByte), but I have to open over 2GByte data on old linux.
 So I implememt wrapper to open large file.
  * Read wapper  :: Split large file to use "split" command and read all split file, if file is larger.
                    So we can load over 2GByte size file on 32 bit linux by using this API.

  * Write wapper :: Input directory, and write files which size is related to input size.
                    So we can devide large file as you want.

  Note: this library only wrap fread/fwrite, not support fseek or other APIs.

How to use:
 Build by make command, and link library in lib directory.
 API is defined in include directory.
 Please see sample dir code.
